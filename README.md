# Drag-Coefficient-Prediction-Using-ML
While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are highly accurate, they are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This research investigates how machine learning combined with physics-based constraints and hybrid loss functions can serve as a faster, reliable model for Cd prediction. It proposes a study on improving the prediction and understanding of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) through data-driven and physics-informed machine learning models. The dataset used in this study is linked in this GitHub repository titled " DrivAerNet_ParametricData"

The Baseline code used for comparison for further models is linked in this github repository as ML_project.
